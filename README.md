# Résumé

This is my résumé. I tried to keep in mind what represents me in color choices, pictures and esthetics. I like contrasts, bright colors and nature. I am quite young in mind and tried to keep my resume youthful without being to childish. I don't know if I was successful but I am quite pleased with some parts and will probably work a bit on others before actually using this résumé for job hunting. It has a little bit of an 90's feel, but hey, I'm a 90's kid so I guess it can count as charmingly old school.


It's in Swedish right now but I hope to do an English version in the near future. I would also like to format the written text a bit more up to my desired standard for a resume. I'm definitely going to format the text before sending it out to potential employers.


My résumé runs pleasingly but I know that some things/functions in my Javascript probably could have been solved in an easier way with less code. For example my image-slider: I sat several hours trying to make it responsive by using the resize-event, but I couldn't make it work without the slider bugging or the need to reload or resize to get the slider running. So I solved it in a way that's probably not the optimal way for a smooth running website, but for this small project it gets the job done.


Another thing I believe I solved in a not the best way at all were the arrows for the small information menu. I noticed them bugging when I clicked one of them, and then clicked another without closing the "old" one. This bug was something I noticed deadline's morning. I had a hard time fixing only one function with parameters for testing all the conditions that needed to be tested (which tabs that were closed or opened), so I took the "easy" way and made several functions (one for each tab-boolean) and then a function only for calling all of the boolean-test functions. This way I could put only the "function-starter" in the functions where I needed to test all these conditions (everytime a small-menu-tab is clicked) but it wouldn't take that much code-space in that function-block. Probably you can solve this easier an with less space with an array and a loop, or proably easier than that. Or I could just learn to use Jquery. Any how, the problem is solved and it works ok.


Also I had problems with responsiveness and position absolute. I solved it by mediaqueries or a function for setting individual padding spaces for the mainInfoContainer-div. Probably there's a much better/easier way to solve the responsiveness of position:absolute elements but alas, I didn't find the the solution this time. Hopefully next time.


I am well aware that one of my Hero-images is very low quality. This is something I'm ment to fix, but I couldn't find the high quality picture in time for the assignments deadline. I am meant to change the hero image to something more high quality in the near future.
